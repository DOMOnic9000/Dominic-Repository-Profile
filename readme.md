GIT is the most popular version control system in the world. It allows users to both record and store data in spaces called repositories, which can then be used to record what, where, when and how users write data. GIT also allows for easier workflow and collaboration, as other means of sending digital data requries lots of folders and time. 

GitHub is an open-source platform that allows users to safely make, store and share their code for multiple purposes. With the use of branches and cloud-based data storage, users can expand and utilize code from both themselves and others for their own projects.

To exclude a specific file type from being tracked in a Git repository, you can add an entry in the "GitIgnore" repository. In order to exclude a file from being viewed, you can use the symbol,"*'file'"; 'file' being the thing you want to be ignored from your files.

In Unity, PlayerPrefs is an easy way to store player preferences throughout different game files. It allows developers to efficienty save player preference data on their personal devices. The functions of Player Prefs also include saving player progress in games, handling the customization of the player character and/or other objects, and caching data. Developers should be aware that PlayerPrefs is usefuly for storing small amounts of data, and not large or senstive data.

## Week 8
Although I finished my Project Proposal before Spring Break, I have unfortunately not utilized my weekly blocked time not only because of my general confusion surrounding the layout and editing of the Document itself, but also because of a mismanagement of time regarding other work in other classes. Due to other work, I have not properly focused my time and energy into considering what specific days I have the most time to focus my effort on my project versus the day that I don't have enough time.
