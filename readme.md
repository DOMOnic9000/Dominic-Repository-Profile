GIT is the most popular version control system in the world. It allows users to both record and store data in spaces called repositories, which can then be used to record what, where, when and how users write data. GIT also allows for easier workflow and collaboration, as other means of sending digital data requries lots of folders and time. 

GitHub is an open-source platform that allows users to safely make, store and share their code for multiple purposes. With the use of branches and cloud-based data storage, users can expand and utilize code from both themselves and others for their own projects.

To exclude a specific file type from being tracked in a Git repository, you can add an entry in the "GitIgnore" repository. In order to exclude a file from being viewed, you can use the symbol,"*'file'"; 'file' being the thing you want to be ignored from your files.
